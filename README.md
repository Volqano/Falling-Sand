# <SANDBOX SIMULATION>

## Description

Intrigued by possibilities and patterns of cellular automata, I felt inspired to create a sandbox simulation in Python. My goal was to learn more about this fascinating concept while practicing my object-oriented programming skills. This project offers a dynamic platform for experimentation and discovery. With broad room for upgrades, including the addition of new elements and functionalities, it serves as a playground for endless exploration.

## Installation

Make sure you have Python3 and pygame installed

```bash
pip3 install pygame
```

## Controls

Game controls:
- ESC: Quit
- R: Reset surface
- SPACE: Pause game

Elements control:
- 1: Sand
- 2: Water
- 3: Stone
- 4: Eraser

## Future upgrades

Future updates will introduce flammable liquids and solids and transforming the behavior of elements based on their weight.
